**Abstract**
l-Aminoacylase from Aspergillus melleus was co-aggregated with polyethyleneimine and subsequently cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to obtain aminoacylaseâ€“polyethyleneimine cross-linked enzyme aggregates (termed as AP-CLEA). Under the optimum conditions, AP-CLEA expressed 74.9% activity recovery and 81.2% aggregation yield. The said method of co-aggregation and cross-linking significantly improved the catalytic stability of l-aminoacylase with respect to temperature and storage. AP-CLEA were employed for enantioselective synthesis of three unnatural amino acids (namely: phenylglycine, homophenylalanine and 2-naphthylalanine) via chiral resolution of their ester-, amide- and N-acetyl derivatives. The enantioselectivity of AP-CLEA was the highest for hydrolysis of amino acid amides; was moderate for hydrolysis of N-acetyl amino acids and was the least for hydrolysis of amino acid esters. Furthermore, AP-CLEA were found to retain more than 92% of the initial activity after five consecutive batches of (RS)-homophenylalanine hydrolysis suggesting an adequate operational stability of the biocatalyst.
