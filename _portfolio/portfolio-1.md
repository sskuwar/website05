### Philosophy

“When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”- Steve Job's father.

### Experience

**February 2017 – Present**
* Post Doctoral Research Associate at University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

  * Conduct research using molecular biology techniques.


**October 2016 – January 2016**
* Post Doctoral Research Associate at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA.

  * Conduct research using molecular biology techniques.

**January 2010 – June 2016**
* PhD in Molecular biology, at Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany.

  * In total 114, 86 and 77 serine protease sequences were identified in H. armigera, Spodoptera frugiperda and Manduca sexta genomes, respectively.
  * Serine proteases are highly conserved at their catalytic residues, H57 D102, S195, and N-terminal signature sequence and follow conserved intron-exon structure.
  * Neonate and 4th instar larvae prefered feeding on PI-free diet compared to PI-supplemented artificial diet.
  * Trypsin-specific PIs had a stronger effect on larval and pupal weight than other PIs.
  * Soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor(SKTI) temporarily slowed down the larval growth.
  * Microarray revealed differential regulation of trypsin and chymotrypsin genes in response to SKTI feeding.
  * Enzyme assays revealed an increase in SKTI-insensitive chymotrypsins.
  * The larvae showed diet specific gene expression of digestion and detoxification related genes on cotton and soybean leaves.
  * Gossypol feeding reduced trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase activity in the midgut of larvae and increased loss of enzymes in frass.
  * The larvae grew slowly on plant leaves and had lower trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase activity compared to artificial diet.
  * I identified SKTI-sensitive and SKTI-insensitive proteases in the midgut of larvae fed on SKTI -supplemented artificial diet using affinity purification.
  * SKTI feeding negatively affected proteases, amylase and carboxypeptidase enzymes.
  * No diurnal regulation of protease activity was found in midgut lumen and frass of larvae.
  * Protease gene expression increased in response to SKTI feeding after 6-9 hours.
  * In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive resource of all the digestive proteases from H. armigera, S. frugiperda and M. sexta and adaptive responses studied will help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of adaptation in general.

**April 2009 – December 2009**
* M. Tech. project student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Maharashtra, India.

  * The project entitled "Analysis of phloem proteome of potato in response to pathogen challenge" until December 2013.
  * We were interested in the differentially expressed putative peptides/proteins in the phloem channel of both resistant and susceptible potato cultivars in response to pathogen challenge.

**June 2008 – March 2009**
* Master's degree project student at Plant Molecular Biology Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Homi Bhabha road, Pune, India.

  * Abstract
  * Helicoverpa armigera is polyphagous and devastating insect pest of economic importance. Larval growth on various diets was compared by taking weights. Fecundity of moth is studied. Maximum larval and pupal weight was studied. Amylase activities were detected in all the larval instars, and various diets. Initial instars had lower amylase activity which steadily increased up to the sixth larval instar. Difference in the quantities of amylase in midguts of H. armigera on feeding natural and artificial diets was evident. Legumes, vegetables, flowers and cereal categories were studied by taking representative of each category. Amylase activity and isoform patterns varied on host plant and artificial diet. Artificial diet fed H. armigera larvae had comparatively high amylase activity and several unique amylase isoforms. By studying variation in amylase activity we came to know H. armigera regulates the levels of digestive enzymes in response to macromolecular composition of the diet. These adjustments in the digestive enzymes of H. armigera may be to obtain better nourishment from the diet and avoid toxicity. Study of crude sorghum inhibitor was also studied against amylase. We are also going to study the expression of amylase in various instar and various diets.


**March 2007 – July 2007**
* Project trainee at Biochemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Homi Bhabha road, Pune, India.

  * Worked on the a summer project about "Preparation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates of L-aminoacylase via co-aggregation with polyethyleneimine"

**June 2006 – March 2007**
* Bachelor's degree project student at the Department of microbiology, University of Pune, Pune, India.

  * Abstract:
  * Chitin is the second number of abundant polysaccharide in the world. To utilize this abundant source of macromolecules it need to be degraded in to its monomer. For the degradation of chitin chitinase from bacillus will be a good candidate to utilize. In this project I have screened the chitinase producing bacilli and use it for production of chitin in flask level and visualize the degradation of chitin in to its monomer using thin layer chromatography and enzyme assay.
